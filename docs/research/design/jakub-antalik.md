# Jakub Antalik

jakubantalik.com is the portfolio of a product designer and engineer who led
design at 0x.org and worked at Frame.io and Intercom. It is a small page with a
large amount of craft: a customisation panel, three alternative rendering modes,
and a panel that becomes a bottom sheet on narrow screens. This page records how
it is built, measured in the browser on September 16, 2026, and the two
libraries it links to.

## The page

Measured from the rendered page:

- **Stack.** Plain HTML with `/script.js` and `/lqip.js`. No framework markers.
- **Type.** Inter at 400 and 500, 13 px body text in `rgb(228, 228, 231)` on
  `rgb(15, 15, 15)`.
- **Theme.** `data-theme="dark"` on the root, with a sun icon toggle.
- **Layout.** One column about 490 px wide: a name and theme toggle, a
  two-paragraph bio with underlined inline links, then a segmented control with
  "Projects" and "Selected work" pills.
- **Project cards.** A 58 px icon tile, a title and a two-line description, each
  linking out:

  | Card                   | Link                   |
  | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | Libraries.dev          | libraries.dev          |
  | Transitions.dev        | transitions.dev        |
  | Border beam component  | beam.jakubantalik.com  |
  | Liquid metal component | metal.jakubantalik.com |

- **Card surface.** `border-radius: 16px`, `rgb(24, 24, 24)`, 16 px padding, and
  a stacked shadow: `rgba(0,0,0,.04) 0 1px 3px`, an inset highlight
  `rgba(255,255,255,.04) 0 1px 0`, and a hairline ring
  `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,.06)`. Hover transitions `box-shadow` over 150 ms and
  `background-color` over 200 ms.

## Selected work

The "Selected work" tab breaks out of the narrow column into a full-bleed
two-column grid, about 944 px per column, of ten looping clips and one still.
The clips are MP4s set to `autoplay loop muted playsinline`: liquid metal
buttons, the Libraries.dev hero, a Frame.io iPad sign-in, an install button, a
file explorer, thinking orbs, a border beam, an input and a metal ring.

Behind every video sits a low-quality image placeholder, a base64 data URI from
`lqip.js`, drawn slightly larger than the video (982 px against 944 px). The
blurred still fills the tile before the video decodes, so the grid never shows
empty boxes.

## The customisation panel

A floating card fixed to the right edge lets a visitor restyle the page:

| Control              | Options                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Font                 | Inter, Suisse Intl, Serif, Sans Serif, Monospace, Georgia, Times, Arial, Helvetica |
| Text & Content style | Three toggles: 3D depth, hand-drawn, water                                         |
| Text color           | Default, Black, Gray, Blue, Green, Red, Purple, Amber, plus a spectrum picker      |
| Corner radius        | Slider, default 16                                                                 |
| Logo size            | Slider, default 14                                                                 |
| Background style     | Default, Sunset, Ocean, Forest, Lavender and more                                  |
| Reset all            | Restores every default                                                             |

How the modes are built:

- **Hand-drawn.** Adds `hand-drawn` to `body`, switches the family to Caveat,
  and applies SVG filters `#sketchy` and `#sketchy-subtle` (`feTurbulence` into
  `feDisplacementMap`) so tile edges wobble like ink.
- **Water.** A fixed `.water-overlay` at `z-index: 99998` with pointer events
  off holds 42 DOM raindrops. Each one layers radial gradients with inset
  shadows, under a backdrop filter of
  `blur(0.6px) brightness(0.97) saturate(1.06)`. Each drop lands with
  `raindrop-land-small` over 0.58 s on `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`, an
  overshoot curve. It uses no canvas or WebGL.
- **Backgrounds.** A body class such as `bg-gradient-sunset` sets layered radial
  gradients. Sunset's first is a warm red wash from the top left:
  `radial-gradient(80% 50% at 20% 0%, rgba(220, 80, 60, 0.14), …)`.

## The drawer

Below 768 px the same panel becomes a bottom sheet. The rules, read from the
stylesheet:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .customization-panel {
    position: fixed;
    max-height: 85dvh;
    transform: translateY(100%);
    transition: transform 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
    backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
    z-index: 10001;
  }
  .customization-panel.sheet-open {
    transform: translateY(0);
    overflow: hidden auto;
    scrollbar-width: none;
  }
  .sheet-handle {
    display: block;
    width: 53px;
    height: 4px;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }
}

.sheet-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  inset: -100px 0;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  opacity: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
  transition:
    opacity 0.35s,
    visibility 0.35s;
  z-index: 10000;
}
```

The details that make it feel native:

- **The curve.** `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` leaves the edge fast and lands
  softly. It is the curve the Vaul drawer library uses.
- **A transition, not a keyframe.** Closing mid-open reverses smoothly.
- **The overlay bleeds.** `inset: -100px 0` extends the scrim past both edges,
  most likely so it still covers the page while mobile browser toolbars resize.
- **Dark mode** uses `rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.92)` behind the blur and a handle at
  `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`.
- **Submenus.** `.sheet-back-btn` and `.sheet-submenu` let options drill into a
  second level inside the same sheet.
- **The trigger** is a `.mobile-customize-btn` pill.

## Libraries.dev

"High-crafted UI libraries for AI agents", with 3,597,330 installs shown on the
page. The hero floats sample tiles around a centred headline. It has five
libraries, all React 18+ with no runtime dependencies, about 83 KB gzipped
together:

| Package         | Effect                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `border-beam`   | A rainbow glow that rides any border                       |
| `thinking-orbs` | Dot-orb loading states for AI interfaces                   |
| `liquid-gooey`  | Pieces that merge and morph like goo                       |
| `metal-fx`      | A real-time chrome ring for buttons and icons              |
| `img-fx`        | A WebGL image-generation loader for cards, needing `three` |

Thinking orbs has nine states, including working, searching, solving, listening,
connecting, composing and breathing. Props cover size (64 or 20 px), cursor
gravity, speed, colour, dot count (207), dot size, reach (160 px), bend (19 px)
and orbit paths (50%):

```tsx
import { ThinkingOrb } from 'thinking-orbs'

;<ThinkingOrb state="listening" size={64} />
```

Every library "ships as a prompt": one copy packs the install line, usage and
props for a coding agent. The paid Studio adds deeper tuning and an agent skill.

## Transitions.dev

"UI transitions for AI agents": a catalogue of small transitions, each with a
live demo, filterable by Essential, AI Agents, Effects, Texts and Pro. The free
ones most relevant to us:

- **Panel reveal**, **Modal open/close** with scale, and **Menu dropdown**,
  which opens from its origin.
- **Page side-by-side** forward and back.
- **Texts reveal**, two lines rising with offset stagger, and **Streaming
  text**, words resolving through a soft cross-blur.
- **Thinking states**, a status line that shimmers then swaps, and **Reasoning
  stream**, agent reasoning scrolling by two lines at a time.
- **Shimmer text**, **Matrix dot loader**, **Skeleton to content**, **Toast**,
  **Tabs sliding** and **Icon swap** with scale and blur.

The skill installs the free set and commands for an agent:

```sh
npx skills add Jakubantalik/transitions.dev
npx skills add Jakubantalik/transitions.dev -s transitions-polish
```

Its commands are `transitions reveal` to list, `review` to audit ad-hoc
durations, `apply <name>`, `refine` to map hard-coded durations to motion
tokens, and `polish`. The review, refine and polish commands are read-only.

## What to use for the landing page

- **The drawer recipe as written** for the layer-list drawer and for any mobile
  menu, including the overlay's negative inset.
- **LQIP behind every video tile** so the demo loop and any gallery never flash
  empty.
- **The card surface**, retuned to our ink and paper colours: layered shadows, a
  hairline ring, and hover on `box-shadow` alone.
- **Agent-state transitions for the live-run preview.** Thinking states,
  reasoning stream and streaming text match what the product already shows: step
  narration ([FR-11](/docs/PRD.md#the-run)) and live frames. Port them; the orbs
  are React-only.
- **Restraint.** The portfolio's playful modes work because the base page is
  quiet. A landing page gets one signature interaction, not a panel of them.
