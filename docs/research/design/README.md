# Design research

Research for the Layerhand landing page: eight reference sites and libraries,
read in a logged-in Chrome session on September 16, 2026, plus the Gemini video
tools agents will use to make its footage. Each source has its own page. This
page pulls them together into what the landing page should take from each.

## What the landing page needs

The team asked for a top-tier SaaS landing page that keeps our typeface, uses
one icon system throughout, and uses sticky scrolling, drawer layers, parallax
and Three.js. The product documents add four constraints:

- **The wedge is the artifact.** The page has to make "a layered PSD, not a flat
  JPEG" visible above the fold ([FR-30](/docs/PRD.md#launch-surface)).
- **The demo loop plays silently** and a thirty-second recording must read
  without sound ([FR-32](/docs/PRD.md#launch-surface)).
- **Desktop first.** The page works at 1280 px and up, and says so below that
  width ([NFR-7](/docs/PRD.md#non-functional-requirements)).
- **Waitlist capture** is live on the same page
  ([FR-31](/docs/PRD.md#launch-surface)).

A layer stack is a good fit for depth. Sticky scrolling can pull a retouched
photo apart into its named layers. Parallax can separate those layers in space,
and a drawer can open to show the layer list. Most of the sources below have a
direct recipe for one of those moves.

## The typeface question

"Our existing typeface" means two different things right now:

- **The shipped page** sets everything in `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` with
  `font-synthesis: none` (`src/web/styles.css`). No webfont is loaded.
- **The Figma design system**, a file built today, pairs **Newsreader** for
  display (H1 88/78, tracking -6.5%) with **Geist** for UI (body 15/20). It has
  not reached the repository.

Every recommendation here works with either choice. Two things from the sources
apply whichever wins:

- Jakub Krehel's `better-typography` says applying typography never requires a
  new typeface, and that a serif headline over a sans body reads as deliberate.
  The Figma pairing follows that rule, and Arial alone does not use the
  contrast.
- Every MotionSites prompt pins one family and forbids swapping it. The prompts
  are useful for layout and motion, but their fonts (Figtree, Inter, Inter
  Tight, Helvetica Now) must be replaced with ours.

## Iconography

Use **Hugeicons Stroke Rounded** for every UI icon on the site, **Isocons** for
large illustrative moments, and nothing else. The reasoning, with Iconsax and
Its Hover as alternatives, is in each icon library's page. In short:

| Need                     | Pick                            | Why                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI glyphs at 16–24 px    | Hugeicons Stroke Rounded        | 6,000+ free icons in one style, 1.5 stroke on a 24 px grid, `currentColor`, no-login CDN |
| Feature and section art  | Isocons                         | Isometric line art at 48 px and up that echoes a stack of layers                         |
| Hover-animated accents   | Its Hover, ported               | React and Motion only, with mixed fill and stroke, so port a few animations by hand      |
| Second UI set, if needed | Iconsax free, Linear or Outline | Six styles, but exported SVG hardcodes `#ffffff` and clip-path ids                       |

Rules to apply, from `better-ui`:

- A 1.5 px stroke next to regular text, 2 px next to semibold, and one library
  per surface.
- An outline icon by default and a filled one for the active state. That pairing
  requires a paid Hugeicons style, so use colour and weight for state instead.
- `currentColor` everywhere, sized in `em` next to text and tested at 16 px.
- Contextual icon swaps animate scale `0.25` to `1`, opacity `0` to `1` and blur
  `4px` to `0px`.

## Motion

Each of the four requested techniques, with the recipe to start from:

| Technique     | Start from                                                                             | Source                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sticky scroll | Pinned stage plus scroll-scrubbed video drawn to canvas, with a lerp of 0.12 per frame | [MotionSites lesson](motionsites.md#scroll-scrubbed-video) |
| Sticky scroll | Canvas UI Laser, Particle Scroll or Bend over live HTML                                | [Canvas UI](canvas-ui.md#scroll-driven-effects)            |
| Drawer layers | Bottom sheet: `translateY(100%)` to `0`, 0.4 s `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`        | [Jakub Antalik](jakub-antalik.md#the-drawer)               |
| Drawer layers | Canvas UI Peel, which peels the page back to reveal a layer underneath                 | [Canvas UI](canvas-ui.md#peel)                             |
| Parallax      | Sky, title, then foreground layers moving 0% to 8% while the title stays put           | [MotionSites lesson](motionsites.md#layered-parallax-hero) |
| Three.js      | Image to multi-view to GLB, then Three.js with tone mapping                            | [MotionSites lesson](motionsites.md#threejs-scroll-scene)  |
| Three.js      | Canvas UI Glass Object or Particle Object, which work in every browser                 | [Canvas UI](canvas-ui.md#threejs-objects)                  |

Rules that hold across all of them:

- **Reduced motion.** Parallax, autoplay loops and large movement are disabled
  under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Slides become cross-fades, and press feedback
  and spinners stay. A muted looping hero video running longer than five seconds
  needs a visible pause control (WCAG 2.2.2).
- **Interruptible.** Use CSS transitions for anything the user toggles, such as
  the drawer, and keyframes only for one-shot entrances.
- **Entrances.** Stagger about 100 ms between blocks and about 80 ms per word in
  a headline. Enter from opacity `0`, `translateY(12px)` and `blur(4px)`, and
  exit in 150 ms to `-12px`.
- **Compositor-only.** Animate `transform`, `opacity` and `filter`. The
  MotionSites prompts animate the separate `translate` property so it cannot
  overwrite a `transform` scale.

## Video

Gemini's Videos tool on the team's Pro account produced a 1280x720 clip, ten
seconds long, with sound and a small four-point sparkle in the bottom-right
corner. The watermark remover's CLI takes a file path directly, which suits
agents better than the browser page's file picker. The full pipeline, including
prompt shape and the scroll-scrub encoding, is in
[Landing video pipeline](video-pipeline.md).

## Constraints from our stack

- **No framework.** `src/web` is plain TypeScript that builds DOM nodes and
  bundles through `Bun.serve`. Anything React-only needs a port or a React
  island: Its Hover, the libraries.dev effects, `motion/react` recipes, and the
  React versions of MotionSites prompts. Canvas UI ships vanilla builds,
  Hugeicons has an icon font, and Isocons and Iconsax export raw SVG.
- **No Three.js yet.** `three` is not a dependency. Adding it is one package,
  and it is also what Canvas UI's object effects need.
- **html-in-canvas is Chrome-only.** Canvas UI's page effects need a Chrome flag
  or an origin-trial token registered for our domain. Other browsers get plain
  HTML, so no effect can carry meaning on its own.

## Open questions

1.  Which typeface is "existing": the shipped Arial stack or the Figma Geist and
    Newsreader pairing?
1.  Do we register the html-in-canvas origin trial for the production domain, or
    limit Canvas UI to its object effects that need no flag?
1.  Is a React island acceptable on the landing page, or must every effect be
    ported to plain TypeScript?
