## Where the browser lives

The link we were given, `app.iconsax.io/icons`, returns "OOPS! 404 Error! Page
Not Found". The icon browser is at the root, `app.iconsax.io`, marked beta. The
marketing and docs sites were returning server errors that day.

## The free set

**Six styles:** Linear, Outline, Bold, Twotone, Bulk and Broken. The free tier
has rounded corners only.

**Thirty-four free categories:**

| Astrology       | 36    | Cryptocurrency                | 36    |

Most glyphs repeat across the six styles, so the number of distinct glyphs is
far below 7,140. Searching "layer" returns one layers glyph in all six styles,
plus unrelated matches on "player".

## Browsing and configuring

- **Left rail.** Type (Static, Animated, AI), Corner (All, Rounded, Straight),
  Filter (All, Free, Premium) and categories with counts.
- **Top bar.** Search, with the query in `?search=`, and style chips.
- **Right rail.** Icons selected and Projects, then Configuration.
  - **Design:** colour, stroke from 0.5 to 2.5, size (24 px), and file type
    (`.svg`).
  - **Development:** Vue, React, Svelte, Flutter, Angular, Web Components, Lit,
    React Native, Swift, Kotlin, CSS or Font.
  - **Download** exports the selection.
- **Ads.** A Carbon ad sits inside the grid.

## An icon's panel

Clicking a free icon opens its code, with tabs for SVG, Vue, React, HTML, Svelte
and Web Components. The SVG for `layer` in the Linear style:

- `width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"`.
- `stroke="#ffffff"`, hardcoded rather than `currentColor`.
- `stroke-width="1.5"`, round caps and round joins.
- A wrapper `<g clip-path="url(#clip0_4418_9594)">` with a generated id.

Two fixes before inlining one on a page:

- Replace the stroke and any fill with `currentColor`.
- Remove the `clip-path` group or make its id unique, because the same id
  repeated across many inline icons collides.

An npm package is listed as "coming soon".

## Why it is the alternative

- **Hugeicons has more free glyphs in one style.** Iconsax's 7,140 count the
  same glyphs once per style.
- **Its exports need cleaning.** Hardcoded colour and clip-path ids must be
  fixed before an icon is used inline.
- **Its best feature is style pairs.** Linear by default and Bold for the active
  state follows `better-ui`'s outline-and-fill rule, which Hugeicons' free set
  cannot. If a design needs visible active icons, such as a toolbar, Iconsax is
  the better fit for that surface alone.
