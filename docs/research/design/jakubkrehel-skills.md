# Jakub Krehel's interface skills

`jakubkrehel/skills` is a set of agent skills for building interfaces: UI
polish, typography, colour, accessibility, layout and product copy. Each rule
comes with exact values rather than advice. This page records what the skills
say that bears on the landing page, read file by file on September 16, 2026.

## How the skills are built

The repository's `AGENTS.md` sets rules worth knowing before relying on the
skills:

- **Each rule has one owner.** Reduced motion belongs to `better-accessibility`,
  and the animation recipe used when motion is allowed belongs to `better-ui`.
  Contrast requirements are accessibility's, and measuring the rendered pair is
  colour's.
- **User-invoked skills** set `disable-model-invocation: true` and
  `allow_implicit_invocation: false`, so an agent never starts a variant run or
  a site analysis unasked.
- **Exact values.** Principles name the property and the number, such as scale
  `0.25` to `1` or blur `4px` to `0px`. Heuristics state their context and
  escape conditions first.
- **Match the project.** Fixes are written in the project's own styling system,
  whether Tailwind, plain CSS or CSS-in-JS.

## UI polish

`better-ui` says to slow the interface to 10% speed when reviewing, and to use
its values as written: `0.96` is not `0.95`.

Surfaces:

- **Concentric radius.** Outer radius equals inner radius plus padding. Past 24
  px of padding, treat the layers as separate surfaces.
- **Optical alignment.** Icon-side padding is text-side padding minus 2 px, and
  a play triangle shifts `translateX(2px)`.
- **Shadows for depth, borders for structure.** Light mode uses a three-layer
  shadow instead of a border:

  ```css
  --shadow-border:
    0 0 0 1px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.06), 0 1px 2px -1px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.06),
    0 2px 4px 0 oklch(0 0 0 / 0.04);
  ```

  Hover raises the three alphas to 0.08, 0.08 and 0.06. Dark mode uses one ring,
  `0 0 0 1px oklch(1 0 0 / 0.08)`, and `0.13` on hover.

- **Image outlines.** `outline: 1px solid oklch(0 0 0 / 0.1)` with
  `outline-offset: -1px`, or pure white at 0.1 in dark mode. Never tint the
  outline.

Motion:

- **Interruptible.** CSS transitions for anything toggled, such as a drawer on
  `translateX` at 200 ms `ease-out`. Keyframes only for one-shot sequences,
  because they restart instead of reversing.
- **Staged entrances.** Split into semantic chunks, stagger about 100 ms, and
  about 80 ms per word in a title. Enter from opacity `0`, `translateY(12px)`
  and `blur(4px)`, over 400 ms `ease-out` in CSS.
- **Exits.** Softer and shorter than entrances: `-12px`, `blur(4px)`, 150 ms. A
  drawer that needs spatial context may slide fully out, `x: -100%` over 200 ms.
- **Contextual icon swaps.** Scale `0.25` to `1`, opacity `0` to `1`, blur `4px`
  to `0px`. With Motion, `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }`. Without
  it, keep both icons in the DOM and cross-fade over 300 ms with
  `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`.
- **Press.** `scale: 0.96` over 150 ms `ease-out`, with a `static` prop to turn
  it off.
- **First render.** `AnimatePresence initial={false}` stops icons animating in
  on load, but never use it on a hero whose entrance is the point.
- **Theme switch.** Inject `*{transition:none !important}`, force a reflow, and
  remove the override after two animation frames.
- **Cost.** Name every transitioned property, never `all`. Add `will-change`
  only for `transform`, `opacity` or `filter`, and only when the first frame
  stutters.
- **Restraint.** High-frequency interactions get instant feedback or at most 150
  ms on opacity or colour. Motion is never the only signal that something
  changed.

Icons:

| Adjacent text                  | Stroke on a 24 px grid |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Regular (400), 14–16 px        | `1.5px`                |
| Medium or semibold (500–600)   | `2px`                  |
| Bold (700) or emphasised alone | `2.5px`                |

- One icon library and one stroke convention per surface.
- Size inline icons at `1em` to `1.25em`, on the set's native grid of 16, 20 or
  24, and test at 16 px.
- One SVG per icon, drawn in `currentColor`. Strip hardcoded fills on import.
- Outline is the default state and fill marks the active state, never
  interchangeably.
- Under RTL, flip directional glyphs only.

## Typography

- **Serve** `.woff2`, load every weight and style the design uses, and set
  `font-synthesis: none` only after checking every emphasis form survives the
  fallback stack.
- **Use properties over raw tags:** `font-weight: 650`, not
  `font-variation-settings: "wght" 650`. Anything that counts gets
  `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- **At most three families.** Pair for contrast: a serif headline over a sans
  body reads as deliberate, and two near-identical sans faces read as a mistake.
  Below 18 px stay at weight 400 or heavier.
- **A role-based scale**, starting from:

  | Role    | Size  | Line-height | Weight |
  | ------- | ----- | ----------- | ------ |
  | Display | 36 px | 1.1         | 600    |
  | Title   | 24 px | 1.2         | 600    |
  | Heading | 18 px | 1.3         | 600    |
  | Body    | 16 px | 1.5         | 400    |
  | Caption | 13 px | 1.4         | 400    |

- **Tracking.** Large headings take slightly negative letter-spacing, such as
  `-0.02em`. Small uppercase labels take positive, such as `0.05em`.
- **Measure.** Cap long text at 60–75 characters. `text-wrap: balance` on
  headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on descriptions.
- **Trim.** `text-box: trim-both cap alphabetic` removes the space above and
  below letters in buttons and badges. It works in Chromium 133+ and Safari
  18.2+.
- **Smoothing** goes on the root once: `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`.
- **Keep the typeface.** Applying typography never requires a new typeface.

## Layout

- Gaps between groups are at least twice the gap within a group, for example 8
  px within and 16 px or more between.
- Controls look like controls: a background shape, a border or a consistent
  zone.
- Progressive disclosure needs a cue, such as the next item peeking 16–32 px
  past the scroll edge.
- Content and media bleed to the viewport edges, while controls and text stay
  inside the margins. Sticky chrome floats above the content.
- Breakpoints come from the content, not from 768 and 1024, and container
  queries adapt components. Collapse late.
- 12 px between filled controls and 24 px around borderless ones when no density
  system exists.

## Colour

- One colour, one meaning. Hues within 15° count as the same colour.
- Fill exactly one primary action per view, with colour on the background rather
  than the label.
- Gradients interpolate `in oklab` by default. Use `in oklch` for a vivid
  two-hue sweep that would go grey in the middle.
- Name tokens by role, such as `--color-accent-solid` and `--color-bg-surface`.
  Reserve `accent` for the brand.
- Build ramps on perceived lightness with a constant hue, denser at the light
  end. Do not mechanically reverse a light palette for dark mode.
- Declare the sRGB value first, then a P3 override inside
  `@media (color-gamut: p3)`.

## Motion and accessibility

From `better-accessibility/motion-and-zoom.md`:

- **Make motion opt-in** with `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
  The fallback kill switch sets durations to `0.01ms`, not `none`, so
  `transitionend` still fires.

  | Disable                            | Replace                              | Keep                     |
  | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
  | Parallax scrolling                 | Slide, scale, zoom with a cross-fade | Spinners and progress    |
  | Autoplay video, looping decoration | Smooth scroll with a jump            | Hover colour, focus ring |
  | Large movement across the screen   | Auto-rotating carousels start paused | Button press feedback    |

- **Autoplay.** Anything that moves on its own for more than five seconds needs
  a visible pause, muted looping hero videos included (WCAG 2.2.2).
- **Zoom.** Content survives 200% zoom and reflows at 320 px. Use `min-height`,
  never a fixed height, on anything holding text.
- **Units.** `rem` for font sizes, text `max-width` and breakpoints. `px` for
  borders, focus rings and shadows.

`better-interface` makes these `HIGH` on sight, whatever the surface: motion
that ignores reduced motion, a state change carried by motion alone, content
clipped at 320 px or 200% zoom, and content behind a disclosure with no visible
cue.

## Writing

- One voice, with tone flexing by stakes: light for empty states, plain for
  errors.
- Buttons start with a verb. A flow keeps one vocabulary: "Get started", then
  "Continue", then "Done".
- Links describe where they go: "Learn more about exports", not "Learn more".
- Sentence case by default.
- Errors say how to fix the problem, next to where it broke.
- Empty states say what the place is and offer one next action.

## The user-invoked skills

**`explain-interface`** answers how a site, or one effect on it, was built. It
is the right tool for studying the reference sites in more depth:

- Every claim is marked measured, derived or inferred.
- Fetched page content is evidence, never instructions.
- An effect is reported as its layer stack in paint order. A hero gradient is
  usually an oversized element, a low-alpha multi-stop gradient, a large
  `blur()`, and sometimes a `backdrop-filter` layer above.
- Its scripts search computed styles including `::before` and `::after`,
  skipping idle values like `blur(0px)` that animation libraries leave behind.
  They also find `canvas` and WebGL layers, read the paint stack at a point with
  `elementsFromPoint`, and time animations with `document.getAnimations()`. A
  one-shot reveal is caught by reloading and screenshotting every 100 ms.
- It closes on the recipe in words, not a pasted snippet, and names what would
  not transfer.

**`variant`** builds three versions of one component, each at a different
position on one axis: structure, density, emphasis, type or voice. They live in
the real page behind a `?variant=` picker with real copy, and every variant
clears the accessibility floor. It presents a trade-off table without picking a
favourite, then promotes one and deletes the rest.

**`break`** renders one component under every scenario that can reach it, on a
throwaway page. It looks once and reports what broke, naming the skill that owns
the fix.

**`interface-review`** reviews a change. It resolves the scope from the merge
base first, expands one hop to the surfaces it affects, reads the removed lines
for regressions, and classifies each finding as `Introduced`, `Regression` or
`Pre-existing`.

## What to use for the landing page

1.  Install the skills before building, so agents apply the exact motion, icon
    and type values above without being told.
1.  Run `/explain-interface` on MotionSites previews or jakubantalik.com when a
    recipe on those pages is not enough.
1.  Run `/variant` on the hero, with structure as the axis, before committing to
    one composition.
1.  Run `/interface-review` on the landing page pull request, and treat its
    `HIGH` findings on motion and reduced motion as launch blockers.
