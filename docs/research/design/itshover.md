# Its Hover

Its Hover ("static icons feel dead now") is a library of icons that animate on
hover. Each icon is a React component built with Motion and installed through a
shadcn registry. The site lists 263 icons. This page was read on September
16, 2026.

## The library

- **Author and repository.** Built by Abhijit (@abhijitwt), in
  `itshover/itshover` with 2,669 stars. The site runs on Next.js 16, Tailwind 4,
  shadcn and `motion/react`.
- **Site.** A dark monospace interface with an orange accent, a theme toggle and
  Ctrl+K search.
- **Grid tiles.** Each shows the icon, which animates on hover, with a button to
  copy the component and a `>_` button to copy the install command.
- **Install** one icon through the registry:

  ```sh
  npx shadcn@latest add https://itshover.com/r/layers-icon.json
  ```

  Or install by hand: `npm install motion`, add the shared `types.ts`, and copy
  the component.

## How an icon is built

`layers-icon` has the tags layers, stack, blocks, overlap, organize and group.
Its source, condensed:

```tsx
const LayersIcon = forwardRef<AnimatedIconHandle, AnimatedIconProps>(
  (
    { size = 24, color = 'currentColor', strokeWidth = 2, className = '' },
    ref
  ) => {
    const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()
    const start = () =>
      animate(
        '.top-block',
        { x: -20 },
        { duration: 0.4, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] }
      )
    const stop = () =>
      animate('.top-block', { x: 0 }, { duration: 0.4, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] })
    useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
      startAnimation: start,
      stopAnimation: stop
    }))
    return (
      <motion.svg
        ref={scope}
        onHoverStart={start}
        onHoverEnd={stop}
        width={size}
        height={size}
        viewBox="0 0 120 120"
        fill="none"
        style={{ overflow: 'visible' }}
      >
        <motion.rect
          className="top-block"
          x="44"
          y="22"
          width="56"
          height="36"
          rx="10"
          fill={color}
        />
        <rect x="20" y="62" width="64" height="40" rx="12" fill={color} />
      </motion.svg>
    )
  }
)
```

The pattern is the same for every icon:

- `AnimatedIconProps`: `size`, `color`, `strokeWidth`, `className`.
- `AnimatedIconHandle`: `startAnimation()` and `stopAnimation()`, so a parent
  can trigger the animation from a button's own hover.
- `useAnimate()` scopes selectors to the SVG, and `onHoverStart` and
  `onHoverEnd` run the motion.
- The animations are short transforms, such as a 20-unit slide over 0.4 s on
  `[0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]`.

## What it covers

Icons that suit a SaaS landing page: `layers`, `upload`, `download`, `sparkles`,
`pen`, `eye`, `eye-off`, `camera`, `sliders-horizontal`, `keyframes`,
`mouse-pointer-2`, `brain-circuit`, `cpu`, `send`, `copy`, `trash`, `refresh`,
`lock`, `shield-check`, `credit-card`, `clock`, `checked`, `double-check`,
`external-link`, `link`, `expand`, `moon`, `star`, `heart`, `x`,
`right-chevron`, `down-chevron` and `arrow-narrow-right`. It also has brand
marks, including GitHub, X, LinkedIn, OpenAI, Cursor, xAI and Next.js.

No icon slug contains image, crop, mask, brush, palette, contrast, undo, redo,
zoom, loader, settings, sun or bolt.

**Drawing conventions are mixed.** Brand marks and some UI icons are filled
shapes, like `layers` above on a 120-unit grid, while others are stroked. That
breaks "one optical strategy per surface", so Its Hover cannot be the site's
base icon set.

## Examples

The Examples page shows community components built with the icons: an X sidebar,
an animated navbar with a sliding active indicator, a collapsible sidebar, a
Takeuforward navbar, a Notion sidebar, a macOS-style dock and a profile
dropdown.

## Using it without React

`src/web` has no React. The animations are simple enough to port, so take the
idea rather than the package:

1.  Draw the icon with Hugeicons, so the stroke matches the rest of the site.
1.  Split the moving part into its own `<g>`.
1.  Animate it with a CSS transition on the parent's `:hover` and
    `:focus-visible`, on `transform` only, for example a 2 px shift over 150 ms.
    Turn it off under reduced motion, since the motion is decorative.

Use this for a handful of accents, such as the upload and layers icons in the
hero, rather than every icon on the page.
