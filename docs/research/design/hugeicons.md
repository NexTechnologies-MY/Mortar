# Hugeicons

Hugeicons, by Halal Lab, has more than 60,000 icons in ten styles. One style,
Stroke Rounded, is free: 6,035 icons at the time of reading, on September
16, 2026. It is the recommended icon set for every UI glyph on the landing page.

## The free style

The style bar has three groups, and only one chip carries the "Free" badge:

| Group    | Styles                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Rounded  | Bulk, Solid, Twotone, Duotone, **Stroke (free)** |
| Standard | Duotone, Solid, Stroke                           |
| Sharp    | Solid, Stroke                                    |

Stroke Rounded icons sit on a 24 px grid with a 1.5 stroke, round caps and
joins, and `currentColor`. The free set has no filled twin, so an active state
has to come from colour or weight rather than an outline-to-fill swap.

## Browsing and search

- **Search** covers all 60,000 icons, with autocomplete and an "AI Search"
  toggle. The query goes in the URL as `?search=`.
- **Pages.** The free grid runs to 61 pages. A green dot marks some tiles,
  apparently new or updated icons.
- **Categories.** Counts within Stroke Rounded. Editing, the largest, is a good
  sign for a photo-editing product:

  | Category             | Icons | Category          | Icons |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |
  | Editing              | 601   | Business          | 419   |

Searching "layers" suggests `layers-01`, `layers-02`, `layers-plus`,
`group-layers`, `ungroup-layers` and `layers-logo`.

## An icon's page

Opening `layers-01` in Stroke Rounded shows:

- **Identity.** Breadcrumb Editing › stroke · rounded › layers-01, the font
  glyph `f1f64`, the component name `Layers01Icon`, and "Available in v1.0.0+".
- **Controls.** Stroke width (1.5), size (24 px), colour (`currentColor`) and a
  reset.
- **Code tabs.** Web, React, React Native, Vue, Svelte, Flutter and Angular. Web
  gives `<i class="hgi hgi-stroke hgi-rounded hgi-layers-01"></i>` and React
  gives `<HugeiconsIcon icon={Layers01Icon} />`.
- **Copy and Download**, each as "SVG STROKED". Both open "Sign in to download
  icons", which needs a free account. An agent cannot create one, so agents use
  the routes below.

## Getting icons without an account

**Icon font from the CDN**, the simplest fit for our plain TypeScript page:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.hugeicons.com/font/icons.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <i class="hgi-stroke hgi-layers-01" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</body>
```

- It includes every free icon, as WOFF2, WOFF, TTF, EOT and SVG.
- The docs say no attribution is required.
- `cdn.hugeicons.com/font/hgi-stroke-rounded.css` is deprecated and frozen on a
  2024 build. Use the `use.hugeicons.com` URL.
- An "Icon Set" CDN link (`sets.hugeicons.com/<set-id>.css`) serves only the
  icons you pick, which keeps the font small.
- An icon font renders as text, so give decorative icons `aria-hidden="true"`
  and every icon-only button an accessible name.

**npm packages**, for inline SVG:

```sh
npm install @hugeicons/react @hugeicons/core-free-icons
```

```tsx
import { HugeiconsIcon } from '@hugeicons/react'
import { Notification03Icon } from '@hugeicons/core-free-icons'

export function Bell() {
  return (
    <HugeiconsIcon
      icon={Notification03Icon}
      size={24}
      color="currentColor"
      strokeWidth={1.5}
    />
  )
}
```

- Renderers exist for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular (`hugeicons-icon`) and React
  Native, and the `hugeicons` package covers Flutter.
- `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` holds the icon data, separate from any renderer.
  None of the listed packages is a vanilla renderer, so our page would need a
  small function that turns the data into an SVG, or the icon font.
- Exports are PascalCase names ending in `Icon`, with numbers spelled out:
  `3d-view` becomes `ThreeDViewIcon`.

## For agents

The agent skill bundles the full icon catalogue, so an agent looks names up
instead of guessing them:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/hugeicons/hugeicons --skill hugeicons
```

- It detects the framework from `package.json` or `pubspec.yaml`.
- It greps `references/icon-list.md`, 5,471 JavaScript export names, and a
  Flutter list of 4,547.
- It suggests only free icons unless a Pro licence exists.
- It leaves out props that repeat a default: `size 24`, `currentColor`,
  `strokeWidth 1.5`.

The MCP server, `@hugeicons/mcp-server` on npm, adds live search across all
60,000 icons and glyph data. The docs recommend installing both.

Other routes: a Figma free demo file, a Figma plugin, a Framer plugin, a VS Code
extension, a WordPress plugin, community Blade and Django packages, an Icon Font
Generator and a migration tool.

## Why it fits

- **One style, large enough to never run out.** Six thousand icons in a single
  drawing convention satisfies "one icon library per surface".
- **Right weight for our type.** A 1.5 stroke sits beside regular text, and
  `strokeWidth` goes to 2 beside semibold labels, matching `better-ui`.
- **Our subject is covered.** Editing is the largest free category at 601 icons,
  and layers, Image + Camera and AI glyphs match what a retouching product talks
  about.
- **No build or login.** The CDN font works in plain HTML today, and the agent
  skill keeps generated names correct.
